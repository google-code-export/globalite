Because there's a difference between describing how to use a plugin and how to actually use the plugin in a real application I wrote a very simple and rough Rails sample application with a fully localized User Interface:

Looking at the code you will find out how to:

 * use a different css per locale (language/country)
 * use a different picture per locale
 * set a default css/picture if the translator doesn't specify one
 * UI localization
 * rails core localization examples
 * create a select box of available UI translations
 * get/set the locale only a specific user so other users start by seeing the default translation
 * use a translation with many dynamic arguments
 * nested translation

note: I froze Edge for this sample app (it wasn't required, Globalite works well with older version of Rails). 

To install and run the app, just do the following:

    $ svn checkout http://globalite.googlecode.com/svn/sample/ui globalite-sample-app

edit config/database.example and rename it config/database.yml

    $ rake db:create
    
    $ rake db:migrate
    
    $ ruby script/server
